# Wordle

I wanted to know how many potential words were available left in the Wordle dictionary after each of my guesses. The 'wordleinfo' code allows you to input information from command line about your guesses to see the number of words still potentailly able to be the solution to that Wordle, along with a list of all such words if the user chooses. The 'wordleinfogui' code attempts to make this a more interactive experience than the terminal through a pop-up window that again prompts users for information about their guesses to tell them how many potential solutions still exist.
